***Project 1: Mercury***  
Definitely an interesting idea! Many students will try and take some finance based, S&P data. Pairing it with something else, like the Mercury cycle data will be very interesting, and give you some good practice for aggregating and combining data. However, this may be a bit shallow when it comes to modeling. You may find that you run a couple tests, and not much comes out as there isn't *too* much to work with.

***Project 2: Figure Skating***  
I really like this one. This could be a very interesting to play around with, and a very good example of causal inference modeling. The one thing that you want to make sure you have is a good, clean dataset. It may be slightly difficult to ensure that you have ample data with each competitor, result, judge, and nationality for each. Take a look!

*As I mentioned before, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find some fall back datasets. Any dataset is fine, as long as it is well-structured. If things become a bit too difficult, it's very important to have a fallback you can rely on!*
