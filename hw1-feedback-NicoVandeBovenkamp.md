**Overall:** Good work! You wrote a very detailed analysis plan, problem statement, and description of the data quality. Well done! On the next homework, try and work on your Python and data analysis skills with Pandas and plotting with [Seaborn](https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial).

**Some Notes**

* *Q.2a:* You are definitely right that we are assuming the data is normally distributed (a very common assumption in many statistical analyses). However, normality doesn't just mean that the mean and median are close, but that the data actually *approximately*  follows the mathematical form of a [normal random variable](http://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/). They have tons of very helpful, handy, well studied properties!

**Something to think about**

We touch on this a bit in class,think about how you can apply statistical tests to your data. There are many handy tests to determine difference of means (very useful), tests to determine assumptions of an underlying distribution, etc. For example, there are specific tests which will estimate how close a given distribution is to a normal distribution.
